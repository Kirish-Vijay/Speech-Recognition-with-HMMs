# Speech-Recognition-with-Hidden-Markov-Models-in-Matlab

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Group Assignment: Speech Recognition project undertaken at the University of Surrey in 2023. The project involves developing a simple speech recognizer in Matlab using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for a small vocabulary of eleven keywords. The assignment covers tasks such as feature extraction, model initialization, training, and decoding using the Expectation-Maximization method with the Baum-Welch equations, as well as evaluation using the Viterbi algorithm. The code is implemented from scratch in Matlab, and the repository includes the individual contributions of each team member in a collective technical report.
